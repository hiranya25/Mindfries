# Mindfries — orientation

Start here. This is the map; it deliberately doesn't restate the things that
live elsewhere, because two copies of a fact drift apart.

## What the product is

Evidence-based technical hiring. The principle the whole system is judged
against, from the PRD:

> The AI should not simply judge the candidate. It should collect evidence
> about how the candidate worked, and help the hiring team make a better
> decision.

Not "final code → score". It observes *how* someone works — navigation, code
changes, terminal commands, tests, debugging, AI usage, time patterns — and
turns that into an evidence report a human uses to decide.

**Company flow:** create role → configure assessment → invite candidate →
watch evidence → decide.
**Candidate flow:** enter → understand task → work like an engineer →
explain decisions → submit.

## Where truth lives

| Question | Read |
|---|---|
| What are we building, and why? | [`System_Archetect_And_PRD.md`](System_Archetect_And_PRD.md) — **the source of truth** for product and architecture |
| What is actually built right now? | [`spec.md`](spec.md) — implemented reality vs. the PRD |
| What's done, what's next? | [`task.md`](task.md) |
| How do the apps share data, and why isn't there a FastAPI CRUD backend yet? | [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) — the Supabase decision |
| How does the candidate IDE work internally? | [`candidate/frontend/src/app/ide/`](candidate/frontend/src/app/ide/) — its own spec / task / contributor notes |

## Repo map

```
internal-admin/frontend/  Next.js — Mindfries' own ops panel (PRD §1.11) + the Lead Tracker
                          /admin/{companies,library,sessions,tracker,onboarding,waitlist,costs}
                          (renamed from apps/web/)
candidate/frontend/       Next.js — the Candidate Engineering Workspace (PRD §1.6)
                          /ide is the whole feature; see its own docs
candidate/backend/        FastAPI skeleton — /health and /status only so far
company/frontend/         Next.js — the Company Admin Portal (PRD §1.4): invite candidates,
                          pick a published assessment, review status. Company-facing;
                          distinct from internal-admin/. Reports is a stub — depends on
                          evidence telemetry + evaluation, neither built yet.
supabase/migrations/      The shared Postgres schema — see ARCHITECTURE.md
```

Vercel builds from `candidate/frontend`. `internal-admin/frontend`,
`company/frontend`, and the FastAPI backends are not deployed yet.

## Conventions

- **Next.js here is not the Next.js you remember.** Both apps carry an
  `AGENTS.md` written by `next dev` saying so — check
  `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing framework code.
- **Real, or an honest failure.** The workspace runs real Python (Pyodide),
  real TypeScript (the actual compiler), real git (isomorphic-git), real
  package resolution. Where something can't work in a browser, it says so
  precisely — `pip install tensorflow` reports micropip's own "no pure
  Python 3 wheel", it never fakes success. Keep that.
- **PRs:** never write "Claude" in a PR title or body for this repo.
- Ask before creating a new branch for a PR — this repo has had too many.

## Traps that have already cost time

1. **Root `.gitignore` had an unanchored `lib/`** (Python packaging
   boilerplate) which silently untracked `candidate/frontend/src/lib/` — 13
   real source files. Fixed by anchoring to `/lib/`. If files you added seem
   invisible to git, run `git check-ignore -v <path>` before assuming you
   forgot to `git add`.
2. **`output: "standalone"` breaks Vercel.** It's needed for the Docker
   image, so it's conditional on `VERCEL` not being set. Removing that
   condition breaks deploys with a confusing missing-`.nft.json` error.
3. **Driving the workspace terminal from browser automation is unreliable** —
   see the IDE's contributor notes. Test the shell in Node instead; the
   engine has no DOM imports precisely so that it can be.

## The gap worth knowing about

The workspace captures **no telemetry**, and evidence capture (PRD §1.7) is
the product's whole differentiator. It's also specced to run against a
**Daytona sandbox over a FastAPI WebSocket**, whereas today it runs entirely
in the browser. That's a deliberate staging decision, not an oversight — but
anyone treating the current IDE as feature-complete is reading it wrong.
