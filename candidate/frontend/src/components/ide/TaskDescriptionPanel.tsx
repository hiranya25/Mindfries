export const MOCK_TASK_MARKDOWN = `# Authentication Bug Fix

## Context

You are working on a Node.js REST API for a task management application. The authentication middleware has a bug that allows expired JWT tokens to pass validation under certain conditions.

## Objective

- Identify the bug in the authentication middleware
- Write a fix that correctly rejects expired tokens
- Add at least one test case that reproduces the original bug
- Make sure all existing tests still pass

## Constraints

- **Time limit**: shown in the header above
- **You may use the AI assistant** for help — how you use it is part of the evaluation
- Use the terminal to run tests: \`npm test\`

## Getting Started

- Read through \`src/middleware/auth.js\`
- Check the existing tests in \`tests/auth.test.js\`
- The bug is in the token expiry check

## Evaluation

Your work will be evaluated on:
- **Correctness** — does the fix actually solve the problem?
- **Process** — how you approached debugging (explored the codebase, reproduced the issue, validated the fix)
- **Code quality** — clean, readable changes
- **Testing** — did you verify your fix with tests?
